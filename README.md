# Sorting-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer project is an interactive web tool designed to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work. Users can select from various algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, and watch the sorting process unfold in real time.

Key Features:
Interactive Controls: Users can generate a new random array, choose a sorting algorithm, and initiate the sorting process with a button click.

Algorithm Selection: A dropdown menu allows users to switch between sorting algorithms, enabling them to compare how each algorithm behaves.

Visual Representation: Each array element is represented by a vertical bar whose height corresponds to its value. As the algorithm sorts the array, the bars rearrange in real time, providing a clear visual of the sorting process.

Animated Transitions: Color changes and animations make it easy to track the active elements being compared and swapped, enhancing the educational value.
